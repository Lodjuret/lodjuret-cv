## Projects

#### Apex World
A table top role playing game that I'm creating for fun. The power system is inspired by the the book Lord of Mysteries and other novels I've read. Future of the project is to create a web app helper for handling combat and other niceties.

#### TreeBase
A project to handle recruitment of volunteers for non-profit organization and the communication with the volunteers. Currently in planning stage, since I ended up with creep scope while I started to code. So a need for a deeper plan is needed. Will try to handle the need of a broad list of organizations but is mostly for the use of √ñland Roots which is a Swedish reggae festival. 

#### LoNix
This is my project for my computer which uses NixOS (LINUX), Home-manager, Flakes and more. NixOS is a declarative approach for managing your computer. So in a more lay mans term for example when installing apps and configuring them you can do so in code. I'm also using AGS to create my own shell, for example the task bar and application launcher. AGS is a middle hand to make it easier to interact with the shell systems. You write AGS code with Typescript.
